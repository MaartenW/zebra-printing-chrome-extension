# Zebra Printing Extension for Google Chrome

Most Zebra Printers have a [HTTP POST endpoint](https://developer.zebra.com/community/home/blog/2015/03/31/printing-from-websites-part-2) through which ZPL can be directly printed without the need for an installed driver, print dialogs popping up or other locally installed software.

Unfortunately those printers [don't set any CORS headers](https://developer.zebra.com/community/home/blog/2015/08/13/http-post-printing-and-cors) which makes it impossible to use this HTTP endpoint in modern browser-based apps.

This extension circumvents this issue.

## Usage

Install this extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ndikjdigobmbieacjcgomahigeiobhbo) in your browser (it's free).

In your web app you can now directly print to Zebra printers by using [`window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage):

    window.postMessage({
        type: "zebra_print_label",
        zpl: "^XA^PW400^LL200^FO20,20^A0N,30,30^FDThis is a TEST^FS^XZ",
        url: "http://192.168.37.36/pstprnt"
    }, "*");

The Zebra Printing extension will listen to those messages and print the `zpl` to the `url`.

- type: The extension will only pick up messages where the type is `zebra_print_label`
- zpl: The ZPL string to be printed
- url: The URL of the printer

The extension will also post a message to the web page upon loading. This way in your web app you can check if the extension is installed:

    window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        if (!event.data.ZebraPrintingVersion) {
            return;
        }
        // extension installed, enable print button or whatever...
        console.log(event.data);
    });

The event will contain two fields:

- ZebraPrintingExtensionId: The extension ID (ndikjdigobmbieacjcgomahigeiobhbo)
- ZebraPrintingVersion: The version number of the installed extension

## Tested Printers

- ZT220 with firmware V72.19.15Z

Feel free to open a pull request to add other supported printers!

## Development

For local development/testing:

    cd testing/
    openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes
    python simple-https-server.py
    open https://localhost:4443/

## Known Limitations

[Zebra printers will always return a `200 OK` status code](https://developer.zebra.com/community/home/blog/2015/12/02/http-post) whether they were able to print or not.
